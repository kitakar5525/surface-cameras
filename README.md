#### Trying to get IPU3 cameras working on Surface devices

#### atomisp/IPU3/IPU4

- Surface 3 uses atomisp (sometimes also called as IPU2)
- Surface gen 4 to 6 devices use IPU3.
- Surface gen 7 devices use IPU4 instead (except SL3, which uses USB cameras instead).

For S3 cameras, I made a separate repo: https://github.com/kitakar5525/surface3-atomisp-cameras

#### What device uses what sensors?

From linux-surface's acpidumps repo and Surface firmware download files:

```bash
# S3 (atomisp)
CAM6 APTA0330 AR0330 # Front cam
CAM1 OVTI8835 OV8835 # Rear cam

# SP/SB/SGO with gen4+ (SP4 and later gen) devices
CAMF INT33BE OV5693
CAMR INT347A OV8865
CAM3 INT347E OV7251 # IR cam

# Note that SP7/SB3 uses ipu4. ipu4 driver isn't upstream and currently
# available up to only 4.19, someone need to port it to newer kernel
# series. Take a look at links section below for more info.

# SL1/SL2 (SL3 uses USB cameras instead)
CAMF OVTI9734 OV9734
CAM3 INT347E OV7251 # IR cam

# non-Surface devices
# Acer Switch Alpha 12
# Front cam is USB
LNK0 INT3479 OV5670 # Rear cam
```

#### usage

First, build kernel with the following changes:

0. Set the kernel config `CONFIG_INIT_STACK_NONE=y` or `CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_USER=y` (https://github.com/kitakar5525/surface-ipu3-cameras/issues/5) to avoid kernel crash.
   Another way is to apply patches currently under development by upstream kernel devs: [[v3,0/8] ipu3-cio2 format and other fixes](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/cover/20201012180414.11579-1-sakari.ailus@linux.intel.com/)
1. Apply software node kernel patch and add bridge driver

   Both software node and bridge driver patches are available in djrscally's repo: https://github.com/djrscally/miix-510-cameras/tree/master/patches

   Note that if the RFC v3 version isn't working on your machine, try my patch that partially reverts to RFC v2: https://github.com/kitakar5525/linux-kernel/commit/70664c3125fc. It can be applied on top of RFC v3.

Then, build sensor drivers:

- Go to sensor drivers dir (e.g., ov5693) and follow the README there

To try to capture images, you can use libcamera:
```bash
# If you use Arch Linux, libcamera-git is available in AUR. If not
# available on your distro, build it yourself:

# clone libcamera
git clone git://linuxtv.org/libcamera.git
cd libcamera
# Dependencies are documented in README.rst file.
# build libcamera with v4l2 compat layer library
meson build -Dv4l2=true --reconfigure
ninja -C build

# to access /dev/media? without sudo, add user to video group:
sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} video
# then logout and login again for it to take effect

# list available cameras:
cam -l

# try to capture images:
qcam
```

Note:

- About the `dsdt-mods` dir: DSDT overriding was needed before because the bridge driver didn't exist then. Now that the bridge driver is stable enough, it's not needed anymore. I'll leave it there for reference.
- About `ov5693` and `ov5693_from_jhand2` dirs: Both drivers are working now. (you can load only one of them at the same time, of course) The former is from atomisp driver and modified to work with ipu3. The latter is from jhand2 and I made some changes. (jhand2 seems to be busy, so I haven't made pull request or something so far yet)

Intel maintains IPU4 (not IPU3) drivers (crlmodule, ipu4-acpi, and ipu4) at linux-intel-lts repo (up to v4.19):
- https://github.com/intel/linux-intel-lts/tree/4.19/base

Especially, we may be interested in the crlmodule and ipu4-acpi drivers:
- https://github.com/intel/linux-intel-lts/tree/4.19/base/drivers/media/i2c/crlmodule
- https://github.com/intel/linux-intel-lts/blob/4.19/base/drivers/media/platform/intel/ipu4-acpi.c

The crlmodule looks like the common driver for sensors.
"CRL" stands for "common/configurable register list":
- [intel/linux-intel-lts@dc8fd430](https://github.com/intel/linux-intel-lts/commit/dc8fd43018fa26980c43a449d5b273861267fb73)
- [intel/linux-intel-lts@56c075d6](https://github.com/intel/linux-intel-lts/commit/56c075d6b2978a0841aaaffaf978874be5295ba8)

> Common register list based driver is based on a sensor configuration
> file created for a specific sensor module based on a set of
> rules.

Other places providing IPU4 drivers:
- https://github.com/intel/intel-camera-drivers [out-of-tree driver files, outdated]
- https://github.com/clearlinux-pkgs/linux-iot-lts2018 [as patch files]
- https://github.com/clearlinux-pkgs/linux-iot-lts2018-preempt-rt [same as above]

#### Chromebooks

Some Chromebooks use IPU3 with almost the same sensor drivers as upstream. But the sensor driver works anyway because Chromebooks handle power-managements at rather firmware through runtime_pm:
